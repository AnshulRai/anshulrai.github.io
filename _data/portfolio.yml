blurb: <strong> Hi, I'm Anshul Rai!</strong> 

# Currently, I'm working as a freelancer and building software solutions to complex problems for a large organization. I did my undergrad at the National Institute of Technology - Trichy, graduating with a B.Tech degree in Electronics and Communication Engineering. As a lover of technology, I see my future in the industry in the long-term, in some form or the other. I'm an avid reader and am always looking for book recommendations, irrespective of the genre! My experience as a student-athlete in college has cultivated in me a deep love for trying out all sports, but I particularly enjoy playing football and basketball.
