<h4>The Chennai Metro, officially Chennai Metro Rail Limited (CMRL), is a rapid transit system serving the city of Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India. Upon completion, the Chennai Metro will be the first metro project in India that will integrate other public transportation systems and the project is expected to reduce the commuting time by 75% from one end of the city to the other. My contribution involved building a CMS solution.</h4>
