<h3 style="color:#000; text-align: justify; text-transform: none;padding: initial;">-Involved the study of algorithms used in quantum state tomography. Assessed the algorithm's performance and worked on a possible optimization through convex methods by implementing an Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers. Compared algorithm performance in density matrix reconstruction for matrices of mixed state and fairly pure state, with simulation done in Octave. Potential application as a non-invasive alternative to MRI scans.</h3>
